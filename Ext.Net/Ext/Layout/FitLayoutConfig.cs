This class is intended to be extended or created via the layout:'fit' Ext.container.Container.layout config, and should generally not need to be created directly via the new keyword.
    /// Fit layout does not have any direct config options (other than inherited ones). To fit a panel to a container using Fit layout, simply set layout: 'fit' on the container and add a single panel to it.

This sizing of all items can be used to provide a background image that is "behind" another item such as a dataview if you also absolutely position the items.
