    /// Proxy which uses HTML5 session storage as its data storage/retrieval mechanism. If this proxy is used in a browser where session storage is not supported, the constructor will throw an error. A session storage proxy requires a unique ID which is used as a key in which all record data are stored in the session storage object.
    /// 
    /// It's important to supply this unique ID as it cannot be reliably determined otherwise. If no id is provided but the attached store has a storeId, the storeId will be used. If neither option is presented the proxy will throw an error.
    /// 
    /// Proxies are almost always used with a store:
    /// 
    /// new Ext.data.Store({
    ///     proxy: {
    ///         type: 'sessionstorage',
    ///         id  : 'myProxyKey'
    ///     }
    /// });
    /// Alternatively you can instantiate the Proxy directly:
    /// 
    /// new Ext.data.proxy.SessionStorage({
    ///     id  : 'myOtherProxyKey'
    /// });
    ///  
    /// Note that session storage is different to local storage (see Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage) - if a browser session is ended (e.g. by closing the browser) then all data in a SessionStorageProxy are lost. Browser restarts don't affect the Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage - the data are preserved.
